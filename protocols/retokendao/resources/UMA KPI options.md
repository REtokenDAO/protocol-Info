Why UMA’s KPI Options

This was a solution proposed by SuperUMAns (Poopster + Inalittlewhile … thanks!!)
The KPI Options UMA Product choice will also allow us to submit for an additional Gitcoin DGov Bounty
UMA’s solution should be simple to implement (lack of technical / dev / engineering experience)
We will look at implementing KPI Options surrounding the Snapshot proposal (voting) turnout %
Excited that UMA appears to be establishing an excited / engaged community and looking forward to partnering with them to improve our DAO operations!!

Challenges We Faced

People that are not familiar with Options … the “industry verbiage” surrounding options can be overwhelming / confusing.
As a startup / “Baby DAO” … we can speculate about some ideas of KPIs, but until we have more history, will just be mostly “winging it”
